## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A Spotify Developer Account (free)

### Spotify API Setup

1. **Create a Spotify Developer Account**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Log in with your Spotify account

2. **Create a New App**
   - Click "Create an app"
   - Fill in the app details:
     - App name: "Emotion-Based Music Recommendation" (or any name)
     - App description: "Music recommendation based on emotions"
     - Redirect URI: `http://localhost` (or your domain)
     - Category: Website
   - Check the terms and click "Save"

3. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Once created, you'll see your app dashboard
   - Copy your **Client ID**
   - Note: For web apps using Implicit Grant flow, you don't need the Client Secret

4. **Configure the App**
   - Open `scripts/spotify-api.js`
   - Replace `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Client ID:
     ```javascript
     this.clientId = 'your-actual-client-id-here';
     ```

5. **Update Redirect URI**
   - In Spotify Dashboard, go to "Edit Settings"
   - Add your redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost`, `http://localhost:8000`, or your production URL)
   - Update the `redirectUri` in `spotify-api.js` to match:
     ```javascript
     this.redirectUri = window.location.origin + window.location.pathname;
     ```
     This automatically uses your current URL, but make sure it matches what you set in Spotify Dashboard.

### Running the Application

1. **Clone or Download**
   ```bash
   cd "E:\GITHUB PROJECTS\Emotion based"
   ```

2. **Serve the Files**

   ```

   **Option 2: Using Node.js (if installed)**
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

   **Option 3: Using VS Code Live Server**
   - Install "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

   **Option 4: Direct File Opening**
   - Simply double-click `index.html` (some features may be limited)

3. **Open in Browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port you used)

## 🎵 How It Works

4. **Play Music**: Click on a track to play a 30-second preview
5. **Enjoy Visualizations**: Watch the audio visualizer sync with the music

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Emotions

1. Add a new emotion card in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <div class="emotion-card" data-emotion="excited">
       <div class="emotion-emoji">🎉</div>
       <div class="emotion-label">Excited</div>
   </div>
   ```

2. Add emotion query mapping in `scripts/spotify-api.js`:
   ```javascript
   excited: 'energetic upbeat celebration'
   ```

3. Add color scheme in `styles/main.css` and `scripts/visualizer.js`

4. Add background effect in `scripts/emotion-effects.js`

### Modifying Color Schemes

Edit the CSS variables in `styles/main.css`:
```css
:root {
    --color-your-emotion: linear-gradient(135deg, #color1 0%, #color2 100%);
}
```
